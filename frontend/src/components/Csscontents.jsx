  "Welcome to Learn CSS!": "An introduction to the curriculum, its goals, and how to get the most out of it.",
  "Box Model": "The core concept that all HTML elements are rendered as boxes with content, padding, borders, and margins.",
  "Selectors": "Patterns used to select and target the HTML elements you want to style (e.g., class, ID, element type).",
  "Nesting": "A modern CSS feature (and preprocessor feature) that allows writing nested style rules, following the HTML structure.",
  "The cascade": "The process that determines which styles apply when multiple rules try to style the same element, based on origin, specificity, and order.",
  "Specificity": "The algorithm that determines which CSS rule applies to an element when multiple rules target it, based on the selector type (ID > Class > Element).",
  "Inheritance": "The mechanism where some CSS properties (like `color` and `font-size`) are automatically passed down from a parent element to its children.",
  "Color": "Defining the foreground and background colors of elements using keywords, hexadecimal, RGB, HSL, or newer color spaces like LCH and LAB.",
  "Sizing Units": "Various ways to define dimensions, including absolute units (`px`) and relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`, etc.).",
  "Layout": "General techniques and principles for arranging elements on a webpage, often using Flexbox and Grid.",
  "Flexbox": "A one-dimensional CSS layout module for arranging items in a single row or column.",
  "Grid": "A two-dimensional CSS layout module for arranging items into rows and columns.",
  "Logical Properties": "Properties that define spacing and dimensions relative to the flow direction (e.g., `margin-inline-start`) instead of physical directions (e.g., `margin-left`).",
  "Custom Properties": "CSS variables (`--variable-name`) used to store and reuse values throughout a stylesheet.",
  "Spacing": "Controlling the internal (`padding`) and external (`margin`) distance around elements, managed by the Box Model.",
  "Pseudo-elements": "Keywords that let you style a specific part of an element (e.g., `::before`, `::after`).",
  "Pseudo-classes": "Keywords that select elements based on their state or position (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`, `:nth-child`).",
  "Borders": "The lines drawn around the padding of an element, controllable in terms of style, width, and color.",
  "Shadows": "Applying visual effects like `box-shadow` for elements and `text-shadow` for text.",
  "Focus": "Managing the visual indication when an element receives keyboard input focus, critical for accessibility.",
  "Cursors and pointers": "Customizing the mouse cursor that appears when a user hovers over an element.",
  "Z-index and stacking contexts": "Controlling the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap on the screen.",
  "Anchor positioning": "A newer feature for positioning an element relative to a specific 'anchor' element.",
  "Popover and dialog": "Styling for built-in, non-modal (`popover`) and modal (`dialog`) window elements.",
  "Functions": "Built-in CSS tools like `calc()`, `var()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` for dynamic value calculation.",
  "Paths, shapes, clipping, and masking": "Advanced techniques for defining the non-rectangular shape of an element's area or its visible region.",
  "Gradients": "Creating smooth transitions between two or more colors (linear, radial, or conic).",
  "Animations": "Creating complex, multi-step motion effects using `@keyframes` and the `animation` property.",
  "Filters": "Applying graphical effects like blur, grayscale, sepia, and brightness adjustments to an element.",
  "Blend Modes": "Controlling how an element's color blends with the colors below it (`mix-blend-mode` and `background-blend-mode`).",
  "Lists": "Styling ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, including markers and list position.",
  "Counters": "Using CSS to create sequences of numbered content automatically.",
  "Transitions": "Creating smooth, gradual changes in CSS property values over a specified duration.",
  "View Transitions for SPAs": "A modern API for smooth, animated transitions between different page states or views in a Single Page Application.",
  "Overflow": "Specifying how content that is too large to fit in an element's box should be handled (e.g., `scroll`, `hidden`).",
  "Backgrounds": "Controlling background colors, images, size, position, and repetition within an element.",
  "Text and typography": "Styling the appearance of text, including font family, size, weight, line height, and alignment.",
  "Container queries": "Applying styles based on the size of a parent container, rather than the viewport size.",
